title: Vulpix Documentation
---

**Vulpix** is simple, elegant, minimal SSG for your next docs. This project was developed by [codeshaine](https://github.com/codeshaine) for fun. there are better alternatives if you want to have customizability and other things. If you still want to use this then go ahead I won't stop you haha

PS: I forgot to mention This project idea is heavily inspired by [malta](https://malta.pilcrowonpaper.com)
